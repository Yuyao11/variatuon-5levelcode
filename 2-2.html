       <h1>The Pond</h1>
       <h2>BY GREGORY ORR</h2>
    
       <ul>
          <li>Snapping turtles in the pond eat bass, sunfish,</li>
           <li>and frogs. They do us no harm when we swim.</li>   
           <li>But early this spring two Canada geese</li> 
          <li>lingered, then built a nest. What Iâ€™d</li>
          <li>heard of, our neighbor feared: goslings,</li>
          <li>as they paddle about, grabbed from below</li>
          <li>by a snapper, pulled down to drown.</li>
          <li>So he stuck</li>
          <li>hunks of fat on huge, wire-leadered hooks</li>
          <li>attached to plastic milk-bottle buoys.</li>
          <li>The first week he caught three turtles</li>
          <li>and still there are more: sometimes he finds</li>
          <li>the bottles dragged ashore, the wire</li>
          <li>wrapped several times around a pine trunk</li>
          <li>and the steel hook wrenched straight as a pin.</li>
       </ul>
