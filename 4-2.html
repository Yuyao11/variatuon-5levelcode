        <h1>Pond</h1>
<h2>BY GREGORY ORR</h2>
<p>Snapping turtles in the <em>pond eat bass, sunfish,</em><br>
and frogs. They do us no harm when we swim.<br>
But early <em>this spring</em>em two Canada geese<br>
lingered, then built a nest. What Iâ€™d<br>
heard of, our neighbor feared: goslings,<br>
as they paddle about, <em>grabbed</em> from below<br>
by a snapper, pulled down to drown.<br>
So he stuck<br>

<em>hunks of fat on huge, wire-leadered</em> hooks<br>
attached to plastic milk-bottle buoys.<br>
The first week he caught three turtles<br>
and still there <em>are more: sometimes</em> he finds<br>
the bottles dragged ashore, the wire<br>
wrapped <em>several</em> times around a pine trunk<br>
and the steel hook wrenched straight as a pin.</p>
