        <h1>Pond</h1>
        <h2>BY GREGORY ORR</h2>
        <p><em>Snapping turtles in the pond eat bass, sunfish,
        and frogs. They do us no harm when we swim.
        But early this spring two Canada geese
        lingered, then built a nest. What Iâ€™d</em>
        heard of, our neighbor feared: goslings,
        as they paddle about, grabbed from below
        by a snapper, pulled down to drown.
        So he stuck
        
        hunks of fat on huge, wire-leadered hooks
        attached to plastic milk-bottle buoys.
        The first week he caught three turtles
        and still there are more: sometimes he finds
       the bottles dragged ashore, the wire
        wrapped several times around a pine trunk
        and the steel hook wrenched straight as a pin.</p>
